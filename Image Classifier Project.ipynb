    "# Developing an AI application\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/Flowers.png' width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is broken down into multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load and preprocess the image dataset\n",
    "* Train the image classifier on your dataset\n",
    "* Use the trained classifier to predict image content\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll lead you through each part which you'll implement in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "First up is importing the packages you'll need. It's good practice to keep all the imports at the beginning of your code. As you work through this notebook and find you need to import a package, make sure to add the import up here."

The dataset is split into three parts, training, validation, and testing. For the training, you'll want to apply transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping.

    "The pre-trained networks you'll use were trained on the ImageNet dataset where each color channel was normalized separately.

It's best to write a function that preprocesses the image so it can be used as input for the model. This function should process the images in the same manner used for training. \n",

    "As before, the network expects the images to be normalized in a specific way. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`. You'll want to subtract the means from each color channel, then divide by the standard deviation. \n",

You can reorder dimensions using [`ndarray.transpose`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.transpose.html). The color channel needs to be first and retain the order of the other two dimensions."

    "Once you can get images in the correct format, it's time to write a function for making predictions with your model. A common practice is to predict the top 5 or so (usually called top-$K$) most probable classes. You'll want to calculate the class probabilities then find the $K$ largest values.\n",

You need to convert from these indices to the actual class labels using `class_to_idx` which hopefully you added to the model or from an `ImageFolder` you used to load the data ([see here](#Save-the-checkpoint)). Make sure to invert the dictionary so you get a mapping from index to class as well.\n",
